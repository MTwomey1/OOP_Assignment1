Flatbush Zombies (stylized as Flatbush ZOMBiES) are an American rap group 
from the Flatbush section of Brooklyn, New York City, formed in 2010. The
group is composed of rappers Meechy Darko, Zombie Juice and Erick 
"The Architect" Elliott, the latter of which also serves as their regular 
producer. They are part of the East Coast hip hop movement known as 
"Beast Coast," which consists of fellow Brooklyn-based rappers, 
The Underachievers and Pro Era.

Friends since grade school, all three members were born and raised in 
Flatbush and are from Jamaican descent. One of the first things Meech and 
Juice bonded over was Dragon Ball Z. During their teenage years, they 
started dabbling in psychedelics such as psilocybin mushrooms and LSD. 
Juice and Issa Gold of The Underachievers specifically starting looking 
into the indigo lifestyle. Meech said the first time doing mushrooms his 
ego died and had a sort of rebirth of conscience, hence him now being 
a "zombie."

Erick, who had been making his own solo music, decided to bring the group 
together musically around 2010. Their first club performance took place in 
2012 at 307 in Waterloo. The group's popularity grew after releasing the 
"Thug Waffle" video on YouTube where they rapped about their love for 
waffles and weed. Later in the year, Flatbush Zombies released their debut 
mixtape titled D.R.U.G.S., which stands for 
"Death and Reincarnation Under God's Supervision".
