===================================
Flatbush Zombies Visualizer Project
===================================

About:
------
For this assignment, what I plan to do is create a visualization program for the rap group Flatbush Zombies.
Flatbush Zombies are one of my favourite rap groups and I thought it would be interesting to create and view
visuals to their music. Flatbush Zombies are quite unique using unusual and different tones and levels when rapping.
Because of this i figured visualizing their music would provide some interesting results.

Plans:
------
- Begin with a homescreen showing the rap group with options to enter or exit.
- Play different sounds from the group when switching pages.
- Give options: Members, Songs, History.
- Members = shows visuals of 3 members, soundboard for voices, added visulas for each member (Read in info on members)
- Songs = give choce of 3 songs. Click to play/stop/pause, click to visualize, click to show lyrics (Read in), summary on songs.
- History = display history on group. visualize sales, anything linked to history.

Extra:
------
1. Choice of multiple audio visualizations
2. Allow user to change colour of visualization 
3. Allow user to change framrate of visualization
